# Fix Sprint: Navigation Unification & Status/Changelog System

## Summary

This PR implements the first 2 critical phases of an 8-phase fix sprint to close gaps from Days 1-10. The implementation focuses on:

1. **Navigation Unification** - Single-source navigation configuration system
2. **Status & Changelog System** - Public status page + admin CMS with database migrations

## What Changed

### Phase 1: Navigation Unification ✅

**Created:**
- `src/lib/nav/config.ts` - Single-source navigation configuration with:
  - `headerNav` - Main navigation for authenticated users
  - `accountNav` - User account dropdown menu items
  - `adminNav` - Admin panel sidebar navigation
  - `footerNav` - Public footer links
  - Helper functions: `filterByAuth()`, `filterByAdmin()`, `getVisibleNavItems()`

**Updated:**
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Now uses `headerNav` config
- `src/components/UserMenu.tsx` - Now uses `accountNav` config
- `src/components/AdminLayout.tsx` - Now uses `adminNav` config
- `src/components/SiteFooter.tsx` - Now uses `footerNav` config

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for all navigation
- Consistent icon usage across the app
- Easy to add/remove/reorder menu items
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces
- Auth-based filtering built-in

### Phase 2: Status & Changelog System ✅

**Database Migrations:**
- `supabase/migrations/20251028182106_create_status_tables.sql`
  - `status_components` - System components (API, DB, DataForSEO, etc.)
  - `status_incidents` - Incident tracking
  - `status_incident_updates` - Incident timeline
  - Seeded with 5 default components
  - RLS policies for public read, admin write

- `supabase/migrations/20251028182107_create_changelog_table.sql`
  - `changelog` - Product update entries
  - Categories: feature, improvement, fix, breaking
  - Published/draft workflow
  - RLS policies for public read (published only), admin full access

**Public Pages:**
- `src/pages/Status.tsx` - Shows:
  - Overall system health
  - Individual component status
  - Recent incidents with severity badges
  - Real-time status from database

- `src/pages/Changelog.tsx` - Shows:
  - Published changelog entries
  - Categorized with color-coded badges
  - Version numbers
  - RSS/JSON feed links (UI placeholders)

**Admin Pages:**
- `src/pages/admin/StatusAdmin.tsx` - Allows:
  - Update component status (operational/degraded/outage/maintenance)
  - Create new incidents
  - Update incident status
  - Severity tracking

- `src/pages/admin/ChangelogAdmin.tsx` - Allows:
  - Create/edit/delete changelog entries
  - Publish/unpublish workflow
  - Rich content (markdown/HTML support)
  - Version tagging
  - Category assignment

**Routes Added:**
- `/status` - Public status page
- `/changelog` - Public changelog page
- `/admin/status` - Admin status management
- `/admin/changelog` - Admin changelog management

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Type Check & Lint
```bash
pnpm type-check  # ✅ Passes
pnpm lint        # ✅ Passes with warnings only
```

### Database Setup
```bash
# Apply migrations (if using local Supabase)
supabase db reset
```

### Manual Testing

#### Navigation
1. **As Guest User:**
   - Visit homepage
   - Header should show: Docs, Status, Changelog, Roadmap
   - Footer should show: Terms, Privacy, Contact, Status, Changelog, Docs

2. **As Authenticated User:**
   - Log in
   - Header adds: Research, Results, SERP, Related, Competitor
   - Click user avatar → Account menu shows: My Research, Profile, Billing, Privacy
   - All navigation items have consistent icons

3. **As Admin User:**
   - Navigate to `/admin`
   - Sidebar shows all admin sections including new Status Admin and Changelog Admin
   - Verify admin navigation is unified and consistent

#### Status Page
1. **Public Status (`/status`):**
   - Should show "All Systems Operational" if all components are operational
   - Lists 5 seeded components: API, Database, DataForSEO, Authentication, Web Application
   - Each component shows current status with icon and badge
   - Recent incidents section (empty initially)

2. **Admin Status (`/admin/status`):**
   - Select dropdown to change component status
   - Click "New Incident" to create an incident
   - Fill in: title, description, severity (minor/major/critical)
   - Update incident status through dropdown
   - Verify public page reflects changes immediately

#### Changelog
1. **Public Changelog (`/status`):**
   - Shows only published entries
   - Entries grouped by date
   - Each entry shows: title, description, content, category badge, version
   - RSS/JSON feed buttons visible (feeds not yet implemented)

2. **Admin Changelog (`/admin/changelog`):**
   - Click "New Entry" to create
   - Fill in: title, description, content (supports markdown/HTML), version, category
   - Toggle "Published" switch
   - Save and verify entry appears on public page (if published)
   - Edit existing entries
   - Delete entries (with confirmation)

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (to be implemented in Phase 1 test task)
pnpm test

# E2E tests (to be implemented in Phase 1 test task)
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Technical Details

### Navigation System Architecture
```typescript
// Example usage
import { headerNav, getVisibleNavItems } from '@/lib/nav/config';

const visibleItems = getVisibleNavItems(headerNav, isAuthenticated, isAdmin);
// Returns only items the user has permission to see
```

### Status System Flow
```
User visits /status
  ↓
Query status_components table (RLS: public SELECT)
  ↓
Query status_incidents table (RLS: public SELECT)
  ↓
Display current status + recent incidents
```

### Admin Status Flow
```
Admin updates component status
  ↓
UPDATE status_components SET status = 'degraded'
  ↓
React Query invalidates cache
  ↓
Public status page auto-updates
```

### Changelog Publishing Flow
```
Admin creates draft entry (published = false)
  ↓
Admin toggles published = true
  ↓
Trigger sets published_at = NOW()
  ↓
Entry visible on public /changelog
```

## Risks & Considerations

### Low Risk ✅
- Navigation changes are purely UI refactors - no breaking changes
- All existing routes still work
- New tables don't affect existing features

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Migration seeding assumes status_components don't already exist
- Admin access relies on `useAdmin()` hook - ensure this check is secure
- RLS policies allow any authenticated user to write (trusting app-level admin check)

### Mitigation
- Add `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to component seeding
- Consider server-side admin verification for write operations
- Future: Add admin role to RLS policies instead of application layer

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
- `status_components` (5 seeded records)
- `status_incidents`
- `status_incident_updates`
- `changelog`

### RLS Policies
All tables have:
- Public `SELECT` access (guests can view)
- Authenticated `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` (admin check at app layer)

### Indexes
- `idx_status_incidents_created_at` (DESC)
- `idx_status_incidents_status`
- `idx_status_incident_updates_incident_id`
- `idx_status_components_display_order`
- `idx_changelog_published`
- `idx_changelog_created_at`
- `idx_changelog_category`

## Remaining Work (Future PRs)

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment
1. Review migrations in staging environment
2. Verify RLS policies work as expected
3. Test admin access controls
4. Verify seeded data is appropriate

### Deployment Steps
1. Apply database migrations
2. Deploy application code
3. Verify `/status` and `/changelog` pages load
4. Verify admin pages require admin access
5. Create first status incident as test
6. Create first changelog entry as test

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor error logs for any RLS policy violations
2. Check that public pages are accessible without auth
3. Verify admin pages reject non-admin users
4. Test navigation on mobile devices
5. Verify all footer links work

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert application code
2. Database tables can remain (non-breaking)
3. Remove routes from App.tsx
4. Old navigation still works as fallback

## Performance Impact

- **Positive:**
  - Reduced code duplication in navigation components
  - Cleaner imports and better tree-shaking
  - Indexes on status/changelog tables for fast queries

- **Neutral:**
  - New database queries for status/changelog (cached by React Query)
  - Minimal payload size increase for navigation config

- **Monitoring:**
  - Watch query performance on status_incidents table
  - Monitor React Query cache hit rates
  - Check for N+1 query issues in admin pages

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- RLS enabled on all new tables
- Public can read, authenticated can write
- Admin verification at application layer (`useAdmin()` hook)

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add admin role verification to RLS policies
- [ ] Add server-side API routes for admin operations
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on write operations
- [ ] Add audit logging for admin actions
- [ ] Add input sanitization for changelog HTML content

## Screenshots

*(Screenshots would be added here in actual PR)*

### Navigation Unification
- Before: Scattered nav definitions
- After: Single config file

### Status Page
- Public view with all components operational

- Create/edit form

## Questions for Reviewers

1. Should RLS policies include admin role verification or keep app-layer checks?
2. Should we implement RSS/JSON feeds now or in a follow-up PR?
3. Should status incidents send email notifications to admins?
4. Should changelog support markdown rendering or only HTML?
5. Should we add more component types beyond the 5 seeded ones?
