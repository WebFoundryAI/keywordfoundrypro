# ðŸš€ Deploy 404 Fix to Production

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Option 2: Manual Git Merge

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Step 1: Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /path/to/keywordfoundrypro

# Step 2: Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Step 3: Pull latest changes from remote
git pull origin main

# Step 4: Merge Claude's fix branch into main
git merge claude/analyze-loveable-project-011CULFteLQCNig6JKdAK7dM

# Step 5: Push to GitHub (this will trigger Loveable.dev deployment)
git push origin main
```

## What Happens After Push

1. âœ… GitHub receives the changes
2. âœ… Loveable.dev auto-deploys to https://keywordfoundrypro.com/
3. âœ… Fix goes live in ~1-2 minutes

## Test After Deployment

1. Go to https://keywordfoundrypro.com/
2. Click "Get Started Now" button
3. Should redirect to keyword research page (NOT 404!)

## If You Get Conflicts

If you see "CONFLICT" message during merge:

```bash
# Abort the merge
git merge --abort

# Use Option 1 instead (Loveable.dev prompt)
```

## File Changed

- `src/lib/researchHome.ts` - Now redirects to `/app/keyword-research` instead of `/app/research/{uuid}`
