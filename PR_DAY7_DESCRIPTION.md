# Day 7: Ops Runbook, Backups & Soft Delete, Analytics Funnel

## Summary

This PR implements Day 7 features as specified, adding operational tooling for admins:
- **Ops Runbook (Admin)**: Versioned markdown operational procedures
- **Backups & Soft Delete**: Nightly backups to Supabase Storage with 30-day retention, soft-delete with admin restore
- **Analytics Funnel (MVP)**: Dashboard showing signup → first query → export → upgrade conversion metrics

All features are admin-only and include comprehensive unit tests.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Apply migrations (dev environment)
supabase db reset

# Verify tables created
supabase db inspect
```

### 2. Runbook
- Navigate to `/runbook` (requires admin)
- Verify initial runbook v1 displays
- Edit runbook and save (should create v2)
- Switch versions using dropdown
- Search for "DataForSEO" or "backup"

### 3. Backups (DEV-only)
```bash
# Create Supabase Storage bucket
supabase storage create database-backups

# Run backup (server-side function or manual trigger)
pnpm tsx scripts/run-backup.ts  # If script exists, or call runBackup() manually
```
- Navigate to `/backups`
- Verify manifests display
- Check retention stats
- Test cleanup preview (don't run actual cleanup)

### 4. Soft-Delete
```bash
# Soft-delete a project
UPDATE projects SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE id = '<project-id>';
```
- As non-admin: verify project hidden
- As admin: navigate to `/backups` → Soft-Delete Restore tab
- Select "projects" table
- Verify soft-deleted record appears
- Click "Restore" → verify deleted_at set to NULL

### 5. Analytics Funnel
```bash
# Seed analytics events
INSERT INTO analytics_events (user_id, event_type) VALUES
  ('<user-1>', 'signup'),
  ('<user-1>', 'first_query'),
  ('<user-1>', 'first_export'),
  ('<user-2>', 'signup'),
  ('<user-2>', 'first_query');

# Refresh materialized view
SELECT refresh_analytics_funnel_view();
```
- Navigate to `/analytics`
- Verify funnel chart displays
- Check metric cards show correct percentages
- Test segmentation filters (plan, date range)
- Verify cohort table displays

### 6. Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm run test

# Run specific test suites
pnpm run test tests/unit/runbook
pnpm run test tests/unit/backup
pnpm run test tests/unit/analytics
```

### 7. Quality Checks
```bash
# Type check
pnpm run type-check

# Lint
pnpm run lint

# All checks should pass with only warnings (no errors)
```

## Risks & Mitigations

### 1. Backup Storage Costs
**Risk**: Large databases could incur significant storage costs
**Mitigation**:
- 30-day retention limit
- NDJSON format (no compression yet, can add gzip later)
- Manual trigger for now (not automated nightly)

### 2. Restore Operations
**Risk**: Full restore could overwrite production data
**Mitigation**:
- DEV-only environment check in `restoreFromBackup()`
- Runtime check: `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` blocks execution
- UI clearly labeled "DEV/STAGING only"

### 3. Soft-Delete RLS Complexity
**Risk**: Complex RLS policies could impact query performance
**Mitigation**:
- Indexed `deleted_at` columns
- Simple `AND deleted_at IS NULL` filter
- Admin policy separate (no filter)

### 4. Analytics Materialized View Stale Data
**Risk**: Funnel metrics could be outdated
**Mitigation**:
- Manual refresh function: `refresh_analytics_funnel_view()`
- Consider cron job for daily refresh (future enhancement)
- Document refresh procedure in runbook

### 5. Backup Manifest Size
**Risk**: JSONB `tables` column could grow large for big databases
**Mitigation**:
- Stores only metadata (rows, file, checksum), not actual data
- File references stored in storage, not inline

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backups**
   - Automated nightly cron job (Edge Function + pg_cron)
   - Gzip compression for storage savings
   - Incremental backups
   - Point-in-time restore

2. **Soft-Delete**
   - Automated purge job for 30+ day old records
   - Cascade soft-delete to related records
   - Bulk restore operations

3. **Analytics**
   - Real-time event tracking via database triggers
   - Automated materialized view refresh (daily cron)
   - Additional funnel stages (e.g., onboarding completion)
   - Retention curves and churn analysis
   - Export to CSV for external analysis

4. **Runbook**
   - Diff viewer between versions
   - Rollback to previous version
   - Section-level editing
   - Full-text search with highlighting

## Notes

- All admin pages require `is_admin = true` in profiles table
- Backup restore is environment-gated (DEV-only)
- Analytics materialized view requires manual refresh initially
- Runbook versioning is append-only (no deletes)
- Soft-delete does not cascade automatically (manual for now)
- Consider adding Edge Functions for automated nightly backups in production
