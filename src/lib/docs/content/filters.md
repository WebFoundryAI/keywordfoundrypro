# Filters & Sorting

Learn how to use filters and sorting to find the best keyword opportunities for your SEO strategy.

## Available Filters

### Search Volume
Filter keywords by monthly search volume to find high-traffic or long-tail opportunities:
- **Minimum Volume**: Set a floor (e.g., 100+ searches/month)
- **Maximum Volume**: Set a ceiling to find less competitive terms

### Keyword Difficulty
Filter by difficulty score (0-100) to match your site's authority:
- **Low (0-30)**: Easy to rank - great for new sites
- **Medium (31-60)**: Moderate competition
- **High (61-100)**: Very competitive - requires strong authority

### Search Intent
Filter by the type of user intent:
- **Informational**: Users seeking knowledge ("how to", "what is")
- **Navigational**: Users looking for a specific site ("login", "near me")
- **Commercial**: Users researching before purchase ("best", "review")
- **Transactional**: Users ready to buy ("buy", "price", "discount")

### SERP Features
Filter keywords that trigger specific SERP features:
- **Featured Snippets**: Position zero opportunities
- **People Also Ask (PAA)**: FAQ opportunities
- **Shopping Results**: E-commerce indicators
- **Local Pack**: Local business opportunities
- **Video**: Video content opportunities

### CPC (Cost Per Click)
Filter by paid search cost to identify:
- **High-Value Keywords**: Higher CPC often means higher commercial intent
- **Low-Competition Paid**: Lower CPC can indicate less ad competition

## Quick Opportunity Filters

Use preset filters for common scenarios:

### Low KD
Shows keywords with difficulty â‰¤30 - easy wins for quick ranking.

### PAA Present
Keywords with "People Also Ask" boxes - great for FAQ content.

### No Shopping
Keywords without shopping results - better for content plays.

### Featured Snippet
Keywords with featured snippets - position zero opportunities.

### Weak SERP
Keywords where competitors have low domain authority - easier to outrank.

## Sorting

Click any column header to sort:
- **Search Volume**: Find high or low traffic keywords
- **Keyword Difficulty**: Sort by ease of ranking
- **CPC**: Identify high-value commercial keywords
- **Intent**: Group by intent type

**Pro Tip**: Combine filters with sorting. For example, filter for "Low KD" + "PAA Present", then sort by "Search Volume Desc" to find easy, high-traffic opportunities with FAQ potential.
