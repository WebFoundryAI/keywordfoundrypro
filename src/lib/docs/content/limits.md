## Understanding Limits

### Queries Per Day
One query = one keyword research run. Reset daily at midnight UTC.

**Tips to optimize:**
- Batch multiple keywords in one query
- Use broader seed keywords to get more variations
- Download sample project to explore features without using queries

### Monthly Credits
Credits are consumed by API calls to DataForSEO. Different operations cost different amounts:
- **Keyword Research**: ~10-20 credits per query
- **SERP Analysis**: ~5 credits per keyword
- **Related Keywords**: ~15 credits per query

**Tips to optimize:**
- Set realistic results limits (100-500 keywords)
- Use cached results when available
- Filter results before running deep analysis

### Export Limits
Maximum rows you can export in a single file.

**For large datasets:**
1. Filter to reduce row count
2. Export in batches
3. Consider upgrading to Pro or Enterprise

## Usage Tracking

Monitor your usage in real-time:
1. Check the dashboard header for current usage
2. View detailed usage in [Account Settings](/account)
3. Set up usage alerts (Pro and Enterprise)
